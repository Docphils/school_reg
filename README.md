## About School_Reg

School_Reg is a project made as part of my assessment to mark the completion of my Laravel course with El Academy. It has was an interesting learning adventure with the prestigious intitution. 

The project is for automating student's registration for a school. We used Meph Academy as the school name. The web app has a landing page, login and signup pages for the school's administrators and a dashboard that aesthetically displays a list of registered learners with their details. 

Laravel Breeze was used to scaffold the application, TaildwindCSS for styling, and Livewire for dynamic interactivity and database queries. 

It's a beauty to behold!
